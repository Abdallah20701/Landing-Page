## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have Visual Studio Code installed—yes, it’s that simple!


### Installing

- First, install Visual Studio Code from here.

- Next, install a plugin to run the project. I recommend using "Live Server." You can find it in the Extensions section of Visual Studio Code.

- If you haven’t downloaded the project files yet, you can do so by cloning the Git repository or downloading it as a ZIP file. Once downloaded, open the files in Visual Studio Code to get started.
