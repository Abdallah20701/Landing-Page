        <h3>Football</h3>
        <p>
          Football, known as soccer in some parts of the world, is the most popular sport globally, celebrated for its
          simplicity, skill, and universal appeal. Played on a rectangular field with two goals, the objective is to
          score by maneuvering a ball into the opposing team’s net using any part of the body except the hands and arms,
          except for the goalkeeper within their area. Football transcends cultural and economic boundaries, uniting
          people through shared passion and competition. With prestigious tournaments like the FIFA World Cup and UEFA
          Champions League, the sport showcases incredible talent, teamwork, and drama, capturing the hearts of
          millions. Its influence extends beyond the pitch, inspiring community building, fostering fitness, and serving
          as a platform for social change and unity.
